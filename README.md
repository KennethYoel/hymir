This Frankenstein graphics framework of mine is for creating and manipulating graphics and images with the goal of creating generative art and simulations.
The software framework I use, that does a lot of the extra (non-creatively oriented) work under the hood and leaves us to just concentrate on the fun stuff,
is called Processing and it has all the benefits of Java with a much simpler and optimized environment for creative coding.
Using the Processing framework, the Java applet disparate and complex operations are standardized into a uniform and simplified set of commands.
So here is the implementation of the Processing core library with my Java project, coding in my IDE of choice instead of using Processing Sketch.
And in time add my own custom RNG and add ffmpeg support as well. For now lets brew some simulations.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
